# Alert Threshold Configuration
# Define min/max acceptable values for each sensor measurement
# Alerts are triggered when values exceed these thresholds

# Temperature thresholds (Celsius)
temperature:
  warning:
    min: 10   # Below this triggers warning
    max: 28   # Lowered - simulated range goes up to 35
  critical:
    min: 5    # Below this triggers critical alert
    max: 33   # Above this triggers critical alert

# Humidity thresholds (Percentage)
humidity:
  warning:
    min: 30
    max: 65   # Lowered - simulated range goes up to 80
  critical:
    min: 20
    max: 75

# Soil moisture thresholds (Percentage)
soil_moisture:
  warning:
    min: 35   # Raised - simulated range starts at 30
    max: 65   # Lowered - simulated range goes up to 70
  critical:
    min: 25
    max: 75

# Alert settings
alerts:
  # Minimum interval between repeated alerts for same condition (seconds)
  cooldown_seconds: 60
  
  # Number of consecutive readings before triggering alert
